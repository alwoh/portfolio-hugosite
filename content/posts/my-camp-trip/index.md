{{< blogparagraph "Here are pictures from my recent camp trip to Columbine Lake.  It was my first time backpacking and we trekked 3 miles from the trailhead parking.  We used the AllTrails app to track our progress, and while it gave it a moderate difficulty rating I'd say with what we packed it was little more than moderate." "">}}
